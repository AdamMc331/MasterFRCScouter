# MasterFRCScouter
A new FRC Scouting Android App that allows for FRC Scouting.
The original version (1.0) was built in the three days leading up to the 2015 Indiana Robotics Invitational (IRI)!

Note: This app currently only supports scouting of the Recycle Rush IRI and Kettering Kickoff events. 
Also, only Match Scouting is the only useable scouting menu.
